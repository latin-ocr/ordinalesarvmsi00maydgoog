Canon Cooke will be long remembered as the donor¹ 01 his
splendid and choice library 01 five thousand rare, vaiuable, and
useful patristic, liturgical, and other works, to the library 01

Sclwyn College, Cambridge. The arrangement, the supervision
01 the binding, and the actual cataloguing 01 this collection was
a work 01 love to him in his later years; and we may hope that
those who arc privileged to use the volumes may catch some 01
the generous and loyal spirit 01 the donor.
