tion, and the Most Holy Name 01 Jesus had come into use,
and the introduction 01 these festivals called 101 a revision 01
Clement Maydeston’s hook.

Soon al'ter our SOCIETY was formed, I learnt that the Rev.
Jonn Roesnr Luu'u, B.D., had transcribed the text os the
Dircctorimn‚ or Pye, from Pynson’s edition 01 1501. He
kindly consented to put his copy at our disposal, and greatly
added to its value by annotating it on the opposite pages,¹
and by writing some introductory explanations, in addition
to some earlier elucidations which he had written 101 me
while Henry Bradshaw was still alive, and while I was engaged
upon a shorter Pye or Ordinule 01 the Breviary. Fourth
Wrangler at Cambridge in 185 3, Fellow 01 St. John's College‚
and in 1857-64 Sadlerian Lecturerf' Mr. Lunn had a genius
101 calculations, and habits 01 mathematical accuracy, combined
with an acquaintance with epacts‚ golden numbers, and bis-
sextiles, scarcely less intimate than that 01 a De Morgan or
a Sir Hatris Nicolas, while his interest in thc mediaeval
kalendar was equal to that 01 a Hampson or a Brady; so
that his death in 1899 has been a discouragcmcnt in my work
as editor and annotator, and a loss to those who use this book.
At the same time we are fortunate in having a good many 01
his notes and papers‚ some 01 which are reserved 101 011
second volume,

The Paschal Table 01 Kalendars in the present volume is
derived lrom his notes, and I can only take credit 101 the
101111 11 which they are combined.

Μ1. Lunn was born at Clceve Prior, in Worcestershire, March
8th, 1831, and was educated at King Edward Vlth's School,

¹ Mt. Lunn, with characteristic ingenuity‚ had made use osan enormous solio
ledger which had originally been ruled 101 a policy-book in his lather's Fire Insurance

Society. Many 01 his notes which he sent me were written on the back 01 answers
written by candidates whom he had examined.

² He was noted sor the sets 01 hard questions propounded to the advanced
mathematicians at St. John's in the college examinations at the end 01 the May term.
These problems were familiarly known as “the Seven Devils.'’
