PREFACE.

Birmingham, under Dr. Prince Lee, being contemporary with
Abp. Benson, Bp. Lightfoot, Canon Wiclrenden, Sir E. Burne-
JoneS, and others. He removed to St. John's College, Cambridge,
and obtained the distinction of being Fourth Wrangler in 185 3,
having done most of his reading while lying on an inclined
plane in weal( health, He ‘⁶ kept '' in rooms on letter E. in the
New Court of St. John's, in the “ corkscrew staircase,” which he
introduced into a mathematica] problem. It wasa proof of
Lunn's strong character that he denied himself the luxury of
having a pianoforte in his college rooms. For he was a born
musician, and had an acute and sensitive ear. Had he been

“he must possess a very good ear for music.’' For many years
he slept with Bach’s 48 preludes 3ηά fugues in a neatly written
volume (“ Lunn’s bible '’) under his pillow.

He was a leading member of the “Old University Musical
Society,'' and of the “ Fitzwilliam Socicty,'’ at Carnbridge; and
after he became vicar of Marton with Gralton, Yorkshire, in the
diocese of Ripon, where he remained for thirty-six years until
his death, he acted as conductor at the York and Ripon festivals.

ΜΓ. Lunn was a first-rate Mathematician,a splendid Musician,
no bad Classic, and an admirable Ecclesiastical Antiquary, an
enthusiastic rubber of sepulchral brasses, and well read in
Theology.¹ Those who knew him best, describe him as
absolutely sincere and childlike, without any of that seli-conceit
which sometimes makes the musician poor company for the less
gifted members of society. He was in many points “a walking
